# Chafan Roadmap

This is the public roadmap for Chafan project.

## Introduction

This is the experimental public roadmap for https://cha.fan. This repository contains information about what we are working on and allows interested users to track our progress and give direct feedback.

## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: One of Chafan's vision about product building is to be open and actively seek user feedback. This type of transparency can make Chafan better overall. Also, this can provide a centralized reference for questions like "when will X be available?".

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Because job zero is security and operational stability, we can't provide specific target dates for features.

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?**

* *Just shipped* - obvious, right?
* *Coming soon* - coming up.  Think a couple of months out, give or take.
* *We're working on it* - in progress, but further out.  We might still be working through the implementation details, or scoping stuff out.
* *Researching* - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still designing, or thinking through how this might work. This is a great phase to send how you want to see something implemented!  We'd love to see your usecase or design ideas here.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: The majority of our development work for Chafan are included on this roadmap. Of course, there will be technologies we are very excited about that we are going to launch without notice to surprise and delight our users.

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

A: Please open an issue!

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue!

**Q: Will you accept a pull request?**

A: No. Please discuss your needs in issues.

**Q: Why is this in English?**

A: Because I copied it from https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap.
